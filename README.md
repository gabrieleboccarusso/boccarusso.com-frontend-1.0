# Frontend of Boccarusso.com

This project contains version 2.0 of the frontend for my website [boccarusso.com](https://boccarusso.com/).

This code was done when I had no absolute knowledge about frontend and instead of getting informed a minimum I have re-invented the wheel by creating a basic [router](https://github.com/gabrieleboccarusso/boccarussofrontend/blob/main/controller.js) and some [apis switchers](https://github.com/gabrieleboccarusso/boccarussofrontend/blob/main/api.js) from scratch. I was actually really surprised of the many things that was possible to do with JavaScript.

It is deployed via netlify and the file 404 contains the same code of the index as a way to have a workaround for making the custom router work and displaying a custom 404 error.

It is no longer maintained and is used mainly as a showcase of bad code.
It is also on the first things that I've made that actually worked while also being used by other people - every errand who would find my website.
